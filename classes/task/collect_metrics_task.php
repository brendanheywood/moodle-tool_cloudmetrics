/**
 * Controls the running of metrics within a single task.
 *
 * Metrics are measured at specific time determined by their frequency. For example, a metric set to FREQ_30MIN
 * is supposed to be measured every thirty minutes.
 *
 * The metrics are required to measured in sync with each other. For example, all FREQ_30MIN are required to
 * be measured at the same time, and those of FREQ_15MIN will also be measured at this time. And so on.
 *
 * This is done by taking the reference time (defaulting to current time), and rounding it back to the nearest clock
 * 'tick'. If the metric was last measured before this time, then it is considered due.
